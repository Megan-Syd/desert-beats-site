The Monday class with Melanie is more suited to dancers with some belly dance experience who want to learn more about this lovely art form and dance to a range of traditional to modern music. If you enjoy a blend of belly dance with more western styles and influences, then our Thursday fusion class will be a good fit. Finally, for something unique and an opportunity to develop improvisation skills with a strong technical style and group collaboration, then check out FCBD® class.",

	{
		title: "What should I wear to class?",
		content: "Wear stretchy, breathable, and comfortable clothing. It is helpful for your instructor if your clothing isn’t too loose. If you have a coin scarf or fringe scarf to wear on your hips, please do; otherwise your instructor can loan you one. Belly dancers often dance with bare feet, although many of us wear dance shoes to class. Common and appropriate options include leather or canvas ballet slippers, 'foot undies', or jazz shoes.",
